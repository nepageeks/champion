<big>&#8220;</big>All of my business dealings with Champion Builders have been pleasant, professional, timely, fair, and honestly handled. Joe has not only competitively bid on several of my projects but have also served as Contractor Of Record for new construction. Their performance and quality of product in the field has always been consistant and excellent. Champion has been timely in the delivery of projects that have demanding schedules and fair and business like in dealing with unforseen conditions and change orders.
<br /><br />
I am personally happy to recommend Joe Mack, Jr. and Champion Builders, Inc. for commercial projects of any scope and with a budget not to exceed twenty million ($20,000,000) dollars.<big>&#8221;</big>

<big>&#8220;</big>Penguin Putnam, Inc. is a division of Pearson plc. headquartered in London, England; a multi-national billion dollar corporation. When I think back to the bid process for the project, it would have been easy to dismiss Champion Builders due to your size at that time. However, you were the only firm that recognized what we needed. You came to the bid meeting with a well thought out plan to meet our schedule. Furthermore, you had met and received commitments from all your sub-contractors to meet the schedule. All other bidders were looking for more time. Let's face it, starting in late April of 1998 with a plan to move books into the warehouse in September of 1998 was quite optimistic. You and your people worked diligently with the architect, our project manager, and my people to meet our goal.

<br /><br />
The quality of work and overall appearance of the building is outstanding. But, it is the little things that are impressive to me. Every problem that occurred, your people were always communicating with us. They were always right on top of things; looking for solutions and recommending better ways. This direct approach was a major factor to the success of the project.<big>&#8221;</big>
